# GiveCrypto Pooled Micro Loans

## Description 

In the world today many people are trapped in poverty because they lack access to the financial resources needed to change their situation. For example, with a loan of $1,000, a farmer in Venezuela earning $20 a month today could move to Bogota and make $2,000 a month as an uber driver, a 100x increase in income. 

For our hack, we worked with GiveCrypto, a charity focused on using cryptocurrency to enable economic freedom, to build a peer-to-peer lending tool that allows people to create micro loan fundraisers that can be used to finance these loans. This lets anyone easily lend funds to people in countries without good financial infrastructure, helping lift people out of poverty. Lenders not only help people in need, but also earn a small amount of interest on their investment. We are helping GiveCrypto run their pilot and have three recipients waiting for loans.
